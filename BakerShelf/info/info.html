  The first printed English language issue of our Journal in English appeared at the end of 2000 (GA No.1â€™2000 in the CIS).It took another fifteen years till the next English language issue in 2015. During the interim we continually monitored the Eastern aviation markets. Reports on these in English attracted the attention of aviators in many countries.
